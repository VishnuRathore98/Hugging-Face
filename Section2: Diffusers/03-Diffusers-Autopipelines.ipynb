    "### Understanding AutoPipeline in Diffusers\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusers offers a wide range of pipelines for generating images, videos, audio, inpainting, and more specialized tasks like upscaling and super-resolution. With so many pipelines available, it can be tricky to know which one to use for a specific task. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Enter the AutoPipeline class!** This class is designed to simplify your workflow by letting you focus on the task at hand without worrying about the specific pipeline class. AutoPipeline automatically detects and uses the correct pipeline class for your task, whether it’s generating text-to-image, image-to-image, or inpainting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How AutoPipeline Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example using the `dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0` checkpoint. Here’s what happens under the hood:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Detection**: AutoPipeline identifies the model type (e.g., \"stable-diffusion\") from the `model_index.json` file.\n",
    "2. **Pipeline Loading**: Depending on your task, it loads the appropriate pipeline class:\n",
    "    - `StableDiffusionPipeline`\n",
    "    - `StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`\n",
    "    - `StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`\n",
    "3. **Parameter Handling**: Any parameters you would pass to these specific pipelines can also be passed to AutoPipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can use AutoPipeline for a text-to-image task:"
