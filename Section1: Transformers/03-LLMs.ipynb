    "## Tokenizing Text\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Tokenization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization transforms text into a format that models can comprehend. There are several methods for tokenizing text, each with its pros and cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character-Based Tokenization**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Splitting the text into individual characters and assigning each a unique numerical ID.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: Works well for languages like Chinese, where each character carries significant information.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Creates a small vocabulary but requires many tokens to represent a string. This can affect performance and accuracy since individual characters carry minimal information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word-Based Tokenization**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Splitting the text into individual words.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: Captures more meaning per token.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Results in a large vocabulary with many unknown words (e.g., typos, slang) and different word forms (e.g., \"run\", \"runs\", \"running\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern Tokenization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern approaches balance character and word tokenization by splitting text into subwords. These methods effectively capture both the structure and meaning of the text while efficiently handling unknown words and different forms of the same word.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subword Tokenization**:\n",
    "  - **Method**: Frequently occurring words or subwords are assigned a single token, while complex words are split into multiple tokens, each representing a meaningful part of the word.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \"flabbergasted\" could be split into:\n",
    "              \n",
    "              tensor(781) \t:  fl\n",
    "              tensor(397) \t: ab\n",
    "              tensor(3900) \t: berg\n",
    "              tensor(8992) \t: asted\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models use different tokenizers, each with its unique strategy and vocabulary size. Let's see how the GPT-2 tokenizer handles a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with GPT-2 Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the GPT-2 tokenizer to tokenize the sentence shown below. This involves converting the text into tokens and then decoding those tokens back into text."

    "\n",
    "Before diving deeper, it's beneficial to experiment with the code above to understand how the model's predictions vary with different inputs. Here are some ideas to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Change a Few Words**: Modify the adjectives in the input string, such as \"dark\" and \"stormy\". Observe how the model's predictions change. Does it still predict \"night\"? How do the probabilities for each token shift?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alter the Input String**: Try different input strings altogether. For instance, instead of \"It was a dark and stormy\", use \"It was a sunny and bright\". Do you agree with the model's new predictions? How do they differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Grammar**: Provide an input string that is not grammatically correct. For example, use \"It was a dark stormy and\". How does the model handle it? Look at the probabilities of the top predictions. Do the probabilities still make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "By experimenting with these changes, you can gain a deeper understanding of how the model processes language and how sensitive it is to different inputs.
